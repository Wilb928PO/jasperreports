JasperReports Change Log
===================================

JasperReports 1.0.1 (2005-0x-xx)
-----------------------------------
- support for pagination;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 1.0.0 (2005-07-20)
-----------------------------------
- built-in support for charts added; a new chart component was added to simplify the
rendering of the following types of charts: Pie, Pie 3D, Bar, Bar 3D, XY Bar, Stacked Bar, 
Stacked Bar 3D, Line, XY Line, Area, XY Area, Scatter Plot, Bubble, Time series, 
High Low Open Close, Candlestick;

- support for generating very large reports using serialization on disk to minimize memory 
consumption during the filling and exporting processes (report virtualizer, contributed by Works Inc.);

- report fields can be of any type, just like report parameters and report variables. 
This simplifies working with JavaBean data sources where casting from java.lang.Object 
to the actual report field class is no longer required in the expressions;

- when using $P{REPORT_SCRIPTLET} in expressions, specific cast to the actual scriptlet
class is no longer needed;

- new attribute "whenResourceMissingType" for customizing the behaviour of the engine 
when it deals with missing resources in the associated resources bundle;

- support for CLOB and BLOB report fields in JRResultSetDataSource;

- support for PDF font registration using properties file;

- simplified support for returning values from subreport;

- new possible value (Band) for the "evaluationTime" property of text fields, images and charts 
to allow postponing their expression evaluation until the end of the parent band rendering 
in order to simplify the use of values returned from subreports;

- support for canceling the report filling process, including the cancellation of the 
report query execution through JDBC (see the AsynchronousFillHandle class);

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 0.6.8 (2005-05-31)

JRExporterParameter.JASPER_PRINT_LIST, which accepts a list containing JasperPrint objects 
(contribution by Jason Essington);
